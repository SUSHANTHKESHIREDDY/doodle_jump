# doodle_jump



DOODLE JUMP is a mobile application game and website based game .Here we created the webite based game using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
we created the game loop, added images onto the canvas, added click handlers to move the doodler jump and move left and right, applied game physics, randomly generated platforms and moved them down the screen, detected collisions between the doodler and each platform, added a running score, and reset the game using javascript.
